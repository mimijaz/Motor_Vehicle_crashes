# Motor Vehicle Crashes â€“ Data Analysis & Heatmap Visualization

### Project Overview

This project analyzes motor vehicle crash data to uncover patterns, hotspots, and insights that could support public safety and urban planning decisions.

Using Python (Pandas, Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I performed:
* Data cleaning & preprocessing of crash data
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in accidents by location, time, and frequency
* Interactive heatmap visualization to highlight accident hotspots

### Key Features

* Data Preprocessing:
 * Handled missing values and standardized coordinates
 * Filtered invalid GPS data points
* Exploratory Data Analysis:
 * Identified peak hours and high-risk locations
 * Evaluated frequency of accidents by boroughs/districts
* Interactive Heatmap:
 *  Created with Folium & Leaflet to visualize accident clusters
 *  Helps identify traffic accident hotspots for decision-makers

### Technologies Used

* Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
* Visualization: Folium Heatmap (Leaflet), Matplotlib
* Data Source: Open motor vehicle crash dataset (e.g., NYC Open Data or similar)

### Sample Visualizations

### Key Insights

* Majority of crashes are concentrated in urban hotspots and intersections
* Certain hours and days show higher accident frequency
* The heatmap provides visual evidence for resource allocation and traffic monitoring

### How to Run

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motor-vehicle-crashes.git

Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook Motor_Vehicle_crashes_ChatGPT2.ipynb

View the interactive heatmap by opening accident_heatmap.html in any browser.

### Portfolio Context
This project demonstrates skills in:
* Data Analysis & Cleaning
* Geospatial Visualization (Heatmaps)
* Insight Generation for Business & Safety Decisions
